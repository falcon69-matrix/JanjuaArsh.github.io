    <p>Naruto has been an inspiration to people all over the world. It has been motivating people for more than twenty years now.
    No matter if you are a hard anime fan or a newbie diving into the world of anime, Naruto is a must watch. Naruto tells the story of NARUTO UZUMAKI, a ninja that strives to earn a name
    for himself and become the strongest of all. On his journey he keeps on changing and inspiring people making new friends where ever he goes. It is a story of
    overcoming pain and fear, starting from the very low to reaching the highest peak, and moreover it is a story of forgiveness, love, friendship and hope.</p>
    <p>TOWN NARUTO is an effort to bring Naruto closer to the hearts of people, to share the hope Naruto brings with everyone,
    to help people understand life better and to learn how to be a better person. Town Naruto aims at bringing hope, joy, motivation and forgiveness to everyone and to share the Mantra of success
    with everyone.</p>

    <p>Other characters like Neji, Gaara, Itachi, Kakashi, Jiraya, Sakura all teach us a valuable lesson. If you don't like what's fate dealt you, do not accept it 
    instead have the courage to fight for a new destiny. Never loose hope. Laziness is the mother of all bad habits. Jealousy and revenge are never fruitfull,
    even though one manages to take ones revenge, it would never lead to happiness instead the suffering only deepens.
    Hardwork and dedication always pays. Hardwork defeats talent, if the talent doesn't work hard enough.
